## Education
### PhD, Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, Aug 2007 – May 2013, GPA 4.0
- [Constructed a novel tomography system termed angled fluorescent laminar optical tomography (aFLOT). Enabling spatial resolution ~200um and peneration depth ~2mm, aFLOT resolves features that are too small for MRI and too deep for confocal microscopy](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/14225/Chen_umd_0117E_14017.pdf)
- Applied in regenerative medicine, aFLOT non-invasively resolved 3D distributions of live human mesenchymal stem cells, which evidenced cell culturing in large engineered tissue, enabling following study of [the 3D functional imaging of whisker stimulation](https://doi.org/10.1364/BOE.7.005218). 
- [building GRIN-lens based laparoscopic-OCT for non-invasive evaluating transplant kidney](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-14998-6_122)
- [OCT imaging of annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fjor.22778)
- building two photon microscopy (TPM) for volunmetric imaging. Maintained (align optics, calibration) mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser, Coherent Mira 900.
