## Personal statement
Years of industrial and academic experience in machine control, interface, and automation to bridge the physical and digital world. As a self-starter, incline to do data driven decision making; quick prototyping to enable iterating designs from collaborative feedbacks; skills to decouple large complex systems; experience in product definition, use cases, requirement analysis, test plan, postmortem documentation. Domain knowledge in system engineering, semiconductors, medical optics, and optimization(mathematics).

## Computer skills
Proficient in Python, Java, and Matlab; GIT, flask; microprocessor<sup>[1](#hardware)</sup>.

## Education
### PhD, Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, Aug 2007 – May 2013, GPA 4.0
- [Constructed a novel tomography system termed angled fluorescent laminar optical tomography (aFLOT). Enabling spatial resolution ~200um and peneration depth ~2mm, aFLOT resolves features that are too small for MRI and too deep for confocal microscopy](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/14225/Chen_umd_0117E_14017.pdf)
- Applied in regenerative medicine, aFLOT non-invasively resolved 3D distributions of live human mesenchymal stem cells, which evidenced cell culturing in large engineered tissue, enabling following study of the 3D functional imaging of whisker stimulation.
